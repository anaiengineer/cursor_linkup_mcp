# Build your own MCP server for Cursor

We're building a custom MCP server, which connects to Cursor and lets it perform deep web searches using [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) amd RAG using LlamaIndex.

### Setup

To sync dependencies, run:

```sh
uv sync
```

### Environment Variables

You need to set up the following environment variables:

```sh
LINKUP_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```
[Get your Linkup API keys here](https://www.linkup.so/)

Ensure these variables are configured correctly before running the application.
